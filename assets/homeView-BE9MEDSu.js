My name is Linus HÃ¥kansson and I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating and exploring.
When I am not working on building websites, you will often find me at the gym or in some sports venue.

My journey in IT began when I was 14-15 years old and built my first computer at home together with my brother. Since then, I have been hooked and love diving into new technologies and solving problems.

I have worked on several projects that have helped me grow both professionally and personally.

Besides computers, technology, and sports, I am also a big nature lover. I enjoy spending time outdoors. These experiences help me stay inspired and creative.

I created this website to share my projects, my thoughts, and to give you a better picture of who I am as a person.
I hope you find something interesting here and do not hesitate to contact me if you want to know more or just say hi!`}}},y={class:"background-color"},f={class:"container margin"};function v(o,w,b,_,e,t){const a=l("card");return h(),i("div",y,[c("div",f,[m(a,{image:e.image,name:t.getCardText(),title:e.socials.name,class:"pre-formatted"},null,8,["image","name","title"])])])}const B=r(u,[["render",v]]);export{B as default};
