My name is Linus HÃ¥kansson and I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating and exploring.
When I am not working on building websites, you will often find me at the gym or in some sports venue.

My journey in IT began when I was 14-15 years old and built my first computer at home together with my brother. Since then, I have been hooked and love diving into new technologies and solving problems.

I have worked on several projects that have helped me grow both professionally and personally.

Besides computers, technology, and sports, I am also a big nature lover. I enjoy spending time outdoors. These experiences help me stay inspired and creative.

I created this website to share my projects, my thoughts, and to give you a better picture of who I am as a person.
I hope you find something interesting here and do not hesitate to contact me if you want to know more or just say hi!`
